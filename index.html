                <p>I am Full Stack web developer who desires to learn as much about the process of web development 
                    as is humanly possible.  I have a particular interest in Java and my favorite part of web development 
                    is developing interfaces between databases and front end clients. However my dream job is a position 
                    where I can touch on all levels of the development of web applications from styling and markup to 
                    accessing data via the DAO layer and everything in between!. </p>
