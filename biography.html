            <div class = "section-item">
                <p> I have three college degrees, two Associate's and one Bachelor's.  I graduated from Sussex County Community College
                    (SCCC) with a degree in Business Administration in 2014.  I went on to get a dual degree in Engineering Science and 
                    Mathematics from SCCC in 2016. I then went to New Jersey Institute of Technology where I graduated with a Bachelor's 
                    of Science in Information Technology with the goal of getting into the field of CyberSecurity.  After graduation I was
                    recruited by Revature LLC and proceeded to join that company in January of 2019.  I was trained in Java full stack 
                    developement with emphasis on automation testing and was assigned a client project at Accenture Federal Services 
                    where I was until May 2020.
