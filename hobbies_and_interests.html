                    <dd>My primary professional interest is Full Stack web development. 
                        I love building new applications and learning new technologies 
                        and how to use existing technologies in new ways.  I want to become
                        an expert in Java and Angular but I am open to learning any web 
                        development technology!

                    <dt>Nature Photogaraphy</dt>
                    <dd>I greatly enjoy taking pictures of all sorts of natural things!  Some of my favorite 
                        subjects are reptiles, amphibians, and mushrooms.  I also like taking pictures 
                        of rainbows and my favorite weather phenomenon are thunderstorms.

                    <dt>Space Exploration</dt>
                    <dd>Ever since I was a kid I have had an interest in space exploration.  I eagerly await 
                        the moment when humanity establishes its first permanent presence on another planet! 
                        I am also excited by the prospect of a permanent moon base that can serve as a scientific
                        outpost and experiment for developing extraterrestial human habitats!

                    <dd>For many years I have had an iterest in geology and particularly in minerals and fossils. 
                        I have spent many years collecting different specimens and have found some very interesting 
                        items over the years.

                    <dt>Creative Writing</dt>
                    <dd>I have always loved to read and from my passion for the written word of others, I developed an 
                        interest in writing my own works.  I like to write poetry (its bad, but I do it anyway), and 
                        sometimes write short stories.  I particulary enjoy fantasy, as it is the genre I was raised on.
